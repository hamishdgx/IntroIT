  <article class="Intro">
    <p>
      My name is Hamish, I grew up in the south east of Melbourne my entire life and have not lived anywhere else. I went through high school and graduated 2019 with decent scores, I took a gap year in 2020 and got stuck in Argentina for two months. Two interesting facts about myself are that I am in a 7 year relationship with my girlfriend Rocio who is Argentinian, and that I am still recovering from a Mild traumatic brain injury from 2018 that left me with quite a lot of memory issues alongside other side-effects.

      The honest answer as to why I am studying IT is because it Pays well and I am decent at it. I donâ€™t necessarily enjoy coding or building applications but I do enjoy maintaining and protecting especially legacy software and equipment. I realised I wanted to go into IT when I was around 12 which is when I first opened up the family computer to mess around with the internals; from then on I steadily built hard-garbage machines and gumtree computers slowly learning ubuntu and UNIX as I could not afford a windows license. All of this intrigue into the hardware of machines made me research and find out that there is quite a bit of money in IT, I think a job that I do not hate that lets me do the things I love is exactly what I want.

      Another reason that IT really appeals to me is because of how much I have been exposed to it, my family founded a Telecommunications billing software development company; and for the past 2 years I have been working there as a "Devops Intern" and then transitioned "Operational engineer grad" So I have been extremely lucky to already be included into the field of IT and somewhat experience what the industry is like.
      After seeing many people at the company I work at come from RMIT with lots of valuable skills not only with the software but communication/business skills I decided to transfer from my Swinburne computer science course to IT in RMIT. Especially with classes going back on campus I am excited to have a full university experience and hope to bring my extroverted capabilities into my University work.

      I really hope to hone my security/sys admin based skills as that is what I find most intriguing about the whole industry, especially growing up researching into tor and getting into OPSEC groups to harden my hardware/software as much as possible. I understand that in order to get to there I need to go through the software development part which I am not too fond of, but I find it as a challenge for myself to go through.
