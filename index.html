    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      My name is Hamish, I grew up in the south east of Melbourne my entire life and have not lived anywhere else. I graduated highschool in 2019 and then took a gap year in 2020 and got stuck in Argentina for two months. Two interesting facts about myself are that I am in a 7 year relationship with my girlfriend Rocio who is from Argentina, and that I am still recovering from a Mild Traumatic Brain injury from 2018 that left me with quite a lot of memory issues alongside other side-effects.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
      The honest answer as to why I am studying IT is because it Pays well and I am decent at it. I don’t necessarily enjoy coding or building applications but I do enjoy maintaining and protecting legacy software and equipment. I realised I wanted to go into IT when I was 12 which is when I first opened up the family computer to mess around with the internals, from then on I steadily built hard-garbage machines and gumtree computers slowly learning ubuntu and UNIX as I could not afford a windows license. All of this intrigue into the hardware of machines made me research and find out that there is quite a bit of money in IT. In reality I want a job that I job that I enjoy that lets me do the things that I love.
      <br><br>
      Another reason that IT appeals to me is because of how much I have been exposed to it. My family founded a Telecommunications billing software development company, and for the past 2 years I have been working there as a "Devops Intern" which then transitioned into "Operational engineer grad" So I have been extremely lucky to already be included into the field of IT and experience what the industry is like.
      After seeing many people at the company I work at come from RMIT with lots of valuable skills not only with the software but communication/business skills I decided to transfer from my Swinburne computer science course to IT in RMIT. Especially with classes going back on campus I am excited to have a full university experience and hope to bring my extroverted nature into my IT work.
      <br><br>
      I really hope to hone my security/sys admin based skills as that is what I find most intriguing about the whole industry, especially growing up researching into tor and getting into OPSEC groups to harden my hardware/software as much as possible. I understand that in order to get to there I need to go through the software development aspect which I am not too fond of, but I find it as a challenge for myself.

  <h2>Ideal job</h2>
    <p>
      My ideal job is one where I can work at my own pace, I would love to go into cybersecurity and potentially operational security for legacy or new systems. From my limited experience this looks like it would suit well with certain Sys admin roles and or Operational engineering roles.
    </p>
    <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/jobs/view/2924955382/?alternateChannel=search&refId=rZc1REd7OLIAlQJEYNblIA%3D%3D&trackingId=ikc9tGY%2FYEBJHL2y9OGoDQ%3D%3D">Ideal job</a>
    <h3>Cloud Security DevOps</h3>
    <p>I believe this closely fits my ideal job because of a few reasons</p>
    <ul>
      <li> Fulfils my want for being on actual deployment projects</li>
      <li> working with Management of a company</li>
      <li> Being able to see actual change from my actions without having to be in front-end development</li>
      <li> Hone my security skills daily and actually challenge myself without providing too much pressure</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The use of multiple cloud based tools and it being in devops, really intrigues me. I feel especially with how fast tools and such move in IT, being in a fast paced Development environment is a very good thing.</p>
    <p>In order to achieve this role, I will need lots of experience in Devops roles, aswell as a very solid understanding of AWS pipelines and such. I think with the path that I am currently on this is achievable within the next 15 years</p>
    <p>My skills are quite limited although broad, in regards to the skills that I have that suit this job; I have a small understanding of AWS with experience launching and maintaining small websites/applicaitons in EC2 and other servcies. Aswell as the AWS experience, since I am already working in Devops I have mild experience in working as a team and collaborating/architecture.</p>
    <p>In regards to how I am going to achieve all of these skills, the best start is one I am already in.. University!. The collaboration aspect of RMIT has already given me much more experience with tools such as Git and with my plan to focus into cloud security topics in the future, I will be able to somewhat learn these skills through the path I am on already. The more complex skills such as kubernetes and other AWS roles, I may have to study and achieve a AWS certificate myself.</p>

    <h3>Learning-style test<h3>
    <a href="https://www.matrix.edu.au/quiz-whats-your-learning-style/">matrix.edu.au</a>
    <h5>labelled as a physical learner</h5>
    <p>"You're a physical learner! You prefer to use your body, hands and touch to learn new material. You need to apply the information and make it your own by making something, role-playing or practicing the technique/skill. You often memorise material when walking and observing, you like to engage in 'hands on' and interactive activities, and learn through doing. " </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Creativity test</h3>
    <h5>56/100 on creativity</h5>
    <ul>
     <li>Risk: 23/26</li>
     <li>Curiosity: 13/24</li>
     <li>Complexity: 11/26</li>
     <li>Imagination: 9/24</li>
     <li>Overall score: 56/100</li>
    </ul>
    <b>What do the results of these tests mean to you?</b>
    <p>I usually do not take these tests very seriously, I feel I have a solid understanding of who I am now as a person and how I work with others so nothing really surprised me. I was happy to see how accurate a lot of the results seemed, I do not see myself as very creative and I am someone who has to do it before learning it; and last of all I am an extroverted person. Although the reason I may not really take these results into account into my person is because of the lack of depth and because of my belief that labels are not needed. For example, I am labelled as extroverted but not in the way that it tells through the results, I do not prefer loud large crowded environments I am extroverted in much more of a quiet sense. </p>
    <b>How do you think these results may influence your behaviour in a team?</b>
    <p>Although I may not see myself as very assertive, I can be when necessary because of my extroverted Ness; I feel that the results especially with the Myers-briggs test will have me presenting a lot and potentially making decisions. Along-side the aspect that I am not very creative (based on my creativity test) will mean that I will rely on others for the creative aspect  </p>
    <b>How should you take this into account when forming a team?</b>
    <p>Because of my lack of creativity I want very different members in my team, I feel I am lucky to be extroverted while in IT as from what I have seen at work it’s a lacking factor in most teams. I want to be able to contribute something different while being a solid team member in all projects not just from this course.  </p>

    <h2>Project Idea</h2>
    <p>I have had quite a lot of trouble brainstorming ideas for this task, after talks with the people around me and what they think is needed in this world of IT I will be creating an application for finding herbs in your area. This will be a website that is mobile friendly that contains community information on where there is herbs planted in your area that you can take and propagate to grow your own herbs, this website will also give descriptions of the herbs with photos and use-cases. I will be building this so that public people can add information to it to help others.
    </p>
    <p>
    This idea sprung to mind after talking to my partner who is in University for biology, specifically conservation and climate change. She has an interest to plants and knows all the plants in our area. I thought that a map of plants around the area would be interesting and fun,  although I thought that this was not feasible and quite a big task. With "Herb and Spice Processing industries revenue anticipated to grow in the next 5 years" (ibisworld.com, 2021) it is safe to assume that more people are trying exotic dishes in their cooking and therefor using more herbs, herb gardens are an easy and sustainable way to reduce processing and carbon emissions while helping out a neighbourhood; but many do not know that they exist or where to find specific herbs which is why a website will help the local community save money and time.
    </p>
    <p>
    By creating a website where you can input your postcode or alternatively use your GPS with the google maps API, it will show you both in list form and on the map where to find all the herbs in your area. Of course this is a lot of data to input as a developer and I cannot go around all of Melbourne/Australia finding every herb garden, therefor there will be an option to add herb gardens that consumers have found/grown themselves; this adds in a community aspect to the website and will increase its accuracy with the option for consumers to "like" the location to confirm its existence and how well maintained the garden is.
    </p>
    <p>
    Alongside this map will be a list of the sightings/herbs in the area which will update based on the map view, this will include information such as how far away it is, its actual location/address, the name of the herb and how many people have liked and confirmed its existence. The list view will also allow you go to the index of herbs, which will be a list of all the herbs in the area detailing specifics such as names, descriptions, a photo for some, and uses in both foods and potential medicine. The index of herb will not be accessible to edit from the pubic in order to ensure reliable information. The website will be hosted in only English at the start as Australia mainly speaks English and as a single developer, I do not have the recourses to accommodate much accessibility; although in the future potential accessibility changes can be made.
    </p>
    <p>
    The website's design will very much be comforting and inviting, as it is not a very professional application and is much more for hobbyist cooks and average people the design will be suited to the demographic of being very safe with non-intensive colours mainly focusing on pastels. The user interface will be very standard for a lot of glossary/index websites, but with the main focus of the website being the map. Due to this being a small project bugs are bound to appear even post development, so having a page where people can submit bug finds with details on the bug and how they created it will be very useful.
    </p>
    <p>
    The input for the map and list will be on a separate page accessible from the header where a user can input the herb from a list that is searchable for the herb they found, small description of the area, an optional photo and the location of the herb which could be a direct address or pin on a map. The reason for the pin on the map option is because many gardens are off streets and will not have specific address's or at least not easily found address's. I believe that the user input is extremely important for a website such as this, not only for its usability but also to create a sense of community in the website.
    </p>
    <p>
    The technologies required for this website are quite simple but important, it will need a basic webserver capable of running the google maps API in specific the MAPS JavaScript API as it will need custom content (developers.google.com) this means that my webserver will also be needing to run basic JavaScript. Due to there being custom content and information stored from user input, a simple database will need to be used; something my MySQL or SQLite will be sufficient as to not overload the cloud instance used. For the webhosting, a physical server is expensive these days and something simple like a small website is not necessary, a cloud instance from a provider such as AWS EC2 or Digital Ocean droplets will be needed to host both the SQL server and the web server.
    </p>
    <p>
    In regards to skills needed to create this application, a decent knowledge of both HTML and CSS is necessary to create the visuals and functionality of the site, and a simple knowledge of JavaScript will be needed to implement the MAPS API. Alongside this a decent knowledge of how to use both AWS or other cloud providers including implementing databases into an instance and both pulling and pushing to said database. I do not believe any special hardware is necessary although the skills and software are all available to be used easily, there is plenty of HTML and CSS training courses online on top of simple AWS ones.
    </p>
    <p>
    If the project is successful I believe it will actually help people, even if it is just removing a minor inconvenience of having to find/buy herbs. Aswell as removing this inconvenience, I believe websites such as these create a sense of community which strengthens the area that many live in and provides a potential form of communication that would normally not be there. With this website it will be easy to find free and sustainable herbs to use when necessary. And through this development I believe that not only will people's lives be impacted but it will reduce the unnecessary waste of plastics being put on herbs in supermarkets as well as the carbon produced from the processing of these herbs; Aswell as making everyone's cooking just a little better.
